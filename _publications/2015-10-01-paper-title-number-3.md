Abstract: 'The aim of this project is to understand cell competition in the context of early in vitro gastrulation. To do so, we construct two models. On the one hand, a deterministic continuous model, and on the other, a stochastic agent-based model. The agent-based models allowed us to study the role of diffusion and interaction length unravelling the different dynamics of cell-cell competition.'

The aim of this project is to understand cell competition in the context of early in vitro gastrulation. To do so, we construct two models. On the one hand, a deterministic continuous model, and on the other, a stochastic agent-based model. The agent-based models allowed us to study the role of diffusion and interaction length unravelling the different dynamics of cell-cell competition.
