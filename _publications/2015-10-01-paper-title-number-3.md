Abstract: The aim of this project is to understand cell competition in the context of early in vitro gastrulation. To do so, we construct two models. On the one hand, a deterministic continuous model, and on the other, a stochastic agent-based model. The agent-based models allowed us to study the role of diffusion and interaction length unravelling the different dynamics of cell-cell competition.'
